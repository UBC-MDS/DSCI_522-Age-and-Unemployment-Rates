Proposal:

The relationship between age and unemployment rates 



## 1. Identify Data set:

Dataset: [Employment: Unemployment rate, by sex and age group](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=54743) by OECD.org. 

## 2 Identify Question:
 “ Is there a relationship between the unemployment rate of developed countries from the years 2006-2016 and the age group or gender of individuals. “
-	This is an example of an Exploratory question. 


## 3. Plan of action for analysis:

  To begin our data-analysis, we plan to look only at observations from developed countries in the past 10 years. We will attempt to discover if the mean unemployment rates are different among gender and subsequently if unemployment rates differ among certain age groups of that particular gender. We will start with statistical inference, using hypothesis testing to conclude which gender has higher values. Next using the data of that particular gender, we will use a similar process to identify if specific age groups of the particular gender have different averages among the developed countries. 

## 4. summarize the data:
